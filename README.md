# Binsta (Instagram for coders)

Binsta - Instagram for Coders

This is one of the school projects I did to show of my skills with especially PHP. For this project I created my own framework but also helped myself by using packages like RedBeanPHP for the database and Twig for templates.

Binsta is a fictional social media platform for coders. It's a place where you can share your code, get feedback, and connect with other developers.
The goal was to recreate the basics of Instagram but put it in another context. Instead of being able to upload images, you can upload code snippets and share it with the community.

The main features include:
- Uploading code snippets
- Commenting on code snippets
- Liking code snippets
- Viewing profiles
